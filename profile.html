    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p>I am a multi-talented, multi-dimensional form of sentience. Some of my acquired skills are: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Contract Negotiation</li>
            <li>Consultative Communication</li>
            <li>Public Speaking</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>I also have discovered many areas of interest during this instance of <span class = "self">{Self}</span>. A few of them are: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Electric Induction Technologies</li>
            <li>DIY Construction of Various Objects</li>
            <li>Creation and Enjoyment of Art and Music</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
    <p>A <span class = "self">{Self}</span> on spaceship Earth requires financial resources in order to fulfill various potentialities of <span class = "self">{Self}</span> such as:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Material</li>
            <li>Intellectual</li>
            <li>Creative</li>
            <li>Kinetic</li>
            <li>Social</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore it behooves the <span class = "self">{Self}</span> to pursue Career Goals. My pursuits are currently prioritized into three categories: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Long-term - To build a successful platform that disrupts one aspect of modern life.</li>
            <li>Medium-term - To level-up my income to over $100k/yr</li>
            <li>Immediate - To pass this course, complete my "visibility packet", and make network contacts.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
